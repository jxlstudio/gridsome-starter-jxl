# Gridsome JXL Starter

## Fontsource-based typeface integration

If you want to change the typeface from Lato, you will need to remove the `fontsource-lato` package via Yarn then add your typeface also via Yarn. More docs and info on Fontsource at https://fontsource.org/docs/getting-started

```
// Example to change from Lato to Open-Sans:
yarn remove @fontsource/lato
yarn add @fontsource/open-sans
```

Then you need to update `main.js`

```
-- import '@fontsource/lato'
++ import '@fontsource/open-sans'
```

Finally, you will need to update `tailwind.config.js`

```
Will add this soon
```
